# ModbusRTUSlave
This library enables an Arduino board to be a Modbus RTU slave/server device, able to communicate with Modbus RTU master/client devices. This library will work with any Stream object such as HardwareSerial or SoftwareSerial, and has provision for use with RS485: a driver enable pin can be set up. This library is like a kit; some assembly is required, but this allows for a lot of customization.

Please note that this is a work in progress and liable to change.
